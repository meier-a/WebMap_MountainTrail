# Mountaineering Tour: SPAGHETTI TOUR SHORT 

## Project Overview
My first web map shows a section of the Spaghetti Tour in the Alps, which I did with a colleague in summer 2023.  The Spaghetti Tour is one of the most popular mountaineering routes in the Alps, with several peaks over 4000 meters above sea level. Summits and huts along the route were highlighted by means of markings.


## Features
- **Interactive Route and Peaks:** The map includes a line marking the route and point markers for peaks and huts, with tooltips showing the names of each.
- **Information panel:** Contains information about the project and the route.
- **Custom Controls:** A Zoom bar and a "Back to Center" button resets the map view.
- **Visible Area Bounds:** The map restricts the view to a specific geographical area for better context.

## Libraries, Style Sheets and Other Data Sources
- **Leaflet.js** (for map creation and customization)
- **jQuery** (for handling DOM manipulation and event handling)
- **Swiss Federal Geoportal** (provides the basemap with detailed alpine topography)
- **Normalize.css, Leaflet.css, and Google Fonts** (stylesheets for the design of the user interface)
